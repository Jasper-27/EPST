# EPST
#### An Electron password strength tester. 


I made this application mainly to learn the basics of how to build an electron app. But you are more than welcome to use it and base your own code on it. 


## Objective 

To transfer my web application i made for Uni into an electron app. 

To provide a quick and easy UI for checking the basic strength a password. 

To show the user the characteristics of a strong password. 

## Images 

### Home screen 

The application is deliberately simple and has only one screen. This is how it looks when first loaded.

### Diagram 

A labelled diagram in case any of it is unclear

### With filled in password

This is what the application looks like after entering a password. The score auto-updates so there is no "Run" button.
